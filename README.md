# pointsbot

This is the unofficial code base for the Points! bot found on the Webex Teams Apphub:
https://apphub.webex.com/teams/applications/points-cisco-systems-6522

In order to use this code, you will need to initialize a number of environment variables (which can be determined by viewing the src/settings.py file).

You can initialize environment variables using an .sh script on unix machines.
export MY_ENVIRONMENT_VAR=XYZ
